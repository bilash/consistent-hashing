# consistent-hashing
A simple consistent hashing implementation in Python.

The underlying data structure (a BST) is also implemented from scratch.
I also added a bunch of tests to test the addition and deletion of nodes.

This implementation can be improved by providing virtual nodes for each node for improved load balancing
while distributing keys evenly to nodes.
